## Research Experience
####  2020.09-present &emsp; Multimedia Analysis and Application Laboratory，HUST，Prof. Yang
- **Description** : RESPIRE: Reducing Spatial-Temporal Redundancy for Efficient Edge-based Industrial Video Analytics.
- **Content** :  As the first author,  the work is submitted to TII (IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IF:10.215, $\color{red} {Accept} $.

####  2021.08-2021.09  &emsp; [ACM Summer School](https://europe.acm.org/hpc-summer-school)     
- **Description** : Teachers from Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, etc., and enterprises such as Nvidia and Huawei, are mainly for young computer science researchers and engineers from all over the world, and only a few undergraduate students are admitted.
- **Content** : Subject is  _HPC computer architectures for AI and dedicated applications._ &ensp;  
&ensp; I  successfully obtained certificate of honor (the best performing students).

####  2021.03-2022.03 &emsp; [Design of  Video Analysis System based on Edge Computing](https://github.com/daixiangxiang/object-detection.git)（_Project Leader_） 
- **Description** : The project to build a test framework, using socket to finish communication. The edge node is simulated by notebook to run the mainstream recognition framework,. After image recognition, the image is compressed by clipping.
- **Content** : Based on VOCdevkit data set, I compared two  detection methods (Faster RCNN and Mobilenet-YOLO ). By  changing resolution and changing the number of  threads to control computing power,  the effect is tested on images and videos.

####  2021.10-2022.01  &emsp; [Construction of knowledge Graph and NLP based on Crawler](https://github.com/daixiangxiang/Crawler-knowledge-map-NLP.git)  （_Project Leader_） 
- **Description** : Based on integration of GUI interface, the project achieves the cleaning of crawled data, the construction of knowledge map by graphical database, and the basic NLP language processing (e.g., word frequency statistics and emotion analysis).
- **Content** : I finished network data crawling, data cleaning, as well as knowledge graph creation and search functions.

####  2021.10-2022.01 &emsp; [Multi Agents Reinforcement learning](https://github.com/daixiangxiang/Reinforcement_learning.git)（_Supervise by Dr. Lin_）
- **Description** : This project mainly uses reinforcement learning multi-agent to simulate multi-edge nodes in video analysis.
- **Content** : I mainly use A3C and MAPPO to realize interactive functions, simulate multi-edge nodes and demonstrate synergistic advantages.

### School Honors
+ 2020-2023, &ensp; Outstanding Undergraduate Student  (Top 1%. Highest honor for undergraduates in HUST) 
+ 2021, &ensp; Winning Prize in  Outstanding Undergraduate Student (16 in 180)
+ 2020, 2021,   &ensp;   National Scholarship for Encouragement (3%) 
+ 2021, &ensp; Optical Valley Morning Star Scholarship (only one in EIC institute in HUST, $: 1576)
+ 2021, &ensp; Self-improvement pacesetter
+ 2020, 2021, &ensp; Scholarship for Academic Excellence & Scholarship for Self-improvement
